# Notification Microservice

This project is the back-end component for the University of Edinburgh's Notification Hub.  It is
developed with Spring Boot 1.4.

## Running this Project

You can run the `notification-ms` project locally (for development) or in a server environment
(TEST, PROD, etc.)

### Running `notification-ms` Locally

Use the following command to run `notification-ms` locally with the Spring Boot Maven Plugin:

```
$ mvn [-Drun.jvmArguments="-Duk.ac.ed.notify.security.basicAuthPassword=CHANGEME"] [clean] spring-boot:run

**NOTE:** Use `-Duk.ac.ed.notify.security.basicAuthPassword=CHANGEME` to specify a password for HTTP
BASIC AuthN (which turns the feature on).
